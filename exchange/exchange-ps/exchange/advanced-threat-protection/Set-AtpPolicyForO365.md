# Set-AtpPolicyForO365

## SYNOPSIS
This cmdlet is available only in the cloud-based service.

Use the Set-AtpPolicyForO365 cmdlet to modify the Advanced Threat Protection (ATP) policy in Office 365. The ATP policy enables the following protections:

- Safe Links for Office 365 ProPlus desktop clients and Office Mobile apps.

- ATP to protect files in SharePoint Online, OneDrive for Business and Microsoft Teams.

For information about the parameter sets in the Syntax section below, see [Exchange cmdlet syntax](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/exchange-server/exchange-cmdlet-syntax).

## SYNTAX

```
Set-AtpPolicyForO365 [[-Identity] <AtpPolicyForO365IdParameter>]
 [-AllowClickThrough <Boolean>]
 [-BlockUrls <MultiValuedProperty>]
 [-Confirm]
 [-EnableATPForSPOTeamsODB <Boolean>]
 [-EnableSafeLinksForClients <Boolean>]
 [-TrackClicks <Boolean>]
 [-WhatIf] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
Safe Links is a feature in Advanced Threat Protection that checks links in email messages to see if they lead to malicious web sites. For more information, see [Office 365 ATP Safe Links](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/atp-safe-links).

ATP can also protect files in SharePoint Online, OneDrive for Business and Microsoft Teams by preventing users from opening and downloading files that are identified as malicious. For more information, see [Office 365 ATP for SharePoint, OneDrive, and Microsoft Teams](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=857638).

You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. Although this topic lists all parameters for the cmdlet, you may not have access to some parameters if they're not included in the permissions assigned to you. To find the permissions required to run any cmdlet or parameter in your organization, see [Find the permissions required to run any Exchange cmdlet](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/exchange-server/find-exchange-cmdlet-permissions).

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1
```powershell
Set-AtpPolicyForO365 -EnableSafeLinksForClients $true -EnableATPForSPOTeamsODB $true
```

This example enables Safe Links for Office 365 ProPlus clients and ATP for SharePoint Online, OneDrive for Business and Microsoft Teams.

## PARAMETERS

### -Identity
The Identity parameter specifies the ATP policy that you want to modify. There's only one policy named Default.

```yaml
Type: AtpPolicyForO365IdParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Online, Exchange Online Protection

Required: False
Position: 1
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -AllowClickThrough
The AllowClickThrough parameter specifies whether to allow users to click through to the original blocked URL in Office 365 ProPlus. Valid values are:

- $true: Users are allowed to click through to the original URL. This is the default value.

- $false: Users aren't allowed to click through to the original URL.

```yaml
Type: Boolean
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Online, Exchange Online Protection

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -BlockUrls
The BlockUrls parameter specifies the URLs that are always blocked by Safe Links scanning. You can specify multiple values separated by commas.

```yaml
Type: MultiValuedProperty
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Online, Exchange Online Protection

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Confirm
The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

- Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: -Confirm:$false.

- Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: cf
Applicable: Exchange Online, Exchange Online Protection

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -EnableATPForSPOTeamsODB
The EnableATPForSPOTeamsODB parameter specifies whether ATP is enabled for SharePoint Online, OneDrive for Business and Microsoft Teams. Valid values are:

- $true: ATP is enabled for SharePoint Online, OneDrive for Business and Microsoft Teams.

- $false: ATP is disabled for SharePoint Online, OneDrive for Business and Microsoft Teams. This is the default value.

```yaml
Type: Boolean
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Online, Exchange Online Protection

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -EnableSafeLinksForClients
The EnableSafeLinksForClients parameter specifies whether Safe Links is enabled for Office 365 apps on desktop clients and on the web. Valid values are:

- $true: Safe Links are enabled for Office 365 apps. This is the default value.

- $false: Safe Links are disabled for Office 365 apps.

This parameter is being replaced by EnableSafeLinksForO365Clients with the same functionality. Use which ever one is currently available in your tenant.

```yaml
Type: Boolean
Parameter Sets: (All)

Applicable: Exchange Online, Exchange Online Protection

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -TrackClicks

Aliases:
Applicable: Exchange Online, Exchange Online Protection

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -WhatIf
